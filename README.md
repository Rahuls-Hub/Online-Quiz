**All about inbuit libraries**
Java comes with a set of code libraries designed to help programmers quickly create applications.
The two import statements know that the application needs access to some of the pre-built functionality contained within the "AWT" and "Swing" code libraries.

AWT stands for “Abstract Window Toolkit.” It contains classes that programmers can use to make graphical components such as buttons, labels and frames. 
Swing is built on top of AWT, and provides an additional set of more sophisticated graphical interface components. 
JFrame is a top-level container that provides a window on the screen.

**Some Functionalities related to buttons**:
**JRadioButton():** Creates an unselected radio button with no text.
 **JRadioButton(String s):** Creates an unselected radio button with specified text.
 **JRadioButton(String s, boolean selected):** Creates a radio button with the specified text and selected status.
 **addActionListener():** This inbuit function provides the facilities to perform various tasks.

**Future Scope**
Making the application of online quiz and handle it over to the School/College teachers this would be the benificial future idea of this project.
They can create and make the changes in questions.
